# WildfireDetection

This was my final year project in university. The goal was to raise public awareness of wildfires, inspired by the Amazon Forest Fire in July 2019.

Instructions to test the app:
- Clone the repository
- Change the 'localhost' in fireServer.py, ListActivity.java and MapActivity.java to your IP address
- Request your own Google Map API and Twitter API keys and replace them in the code
- Run the server first, fireServer.py
- Run the app in Android Studio
- Install Twitter from Google Play Store on Android
